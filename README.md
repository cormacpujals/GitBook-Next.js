In the beginning, the World Wide Web was about publishing textual content that was linked to other content. The format of this content was HTML and the method for requesting it was based on a simple request based protocol called HTTP.

Today, if you want to implement something this basic, you could use Next.js, but that would be overkill. You could use `nginx`, but even that would be overkill. You can easily host static HTML pages using GitHub or a CDN. This is called Static Hosting or Static Site Hosting.
