# Chapter 1, Rendering Pages

Step 1: Remember how an HTML file served to a browser interacts with JavaScript loads

* UI generated from HTML, browser constructs the DOM
* JavaScript can manipulate the DOM (add event listeners, select, update, delete, style, etc.)
* Imperative programming&#x20;

Step 2: Understand how React works (and it's key downside). No pre-rendering (plain React app). The app is hydrated with HTML once the JS is fully loaded (since virtual DOM)

*

Step 3: Understand how/why Next.js is the best option. Mention each of the rendering methods available and transition into the sections.&#x20;
