# Chapter 1, Rendering Pages

Step 1: Remember how an HTML file w/ JavaScript loads

Step 2: Understand how React works (and it's key downside). No pre-rendering (plain React app). The app is hydrated with HTML once the JS is fully loaded (since virtual DOM)

Step 3: Understand how/why pre-rendering with hydration with Next.js is awesome. Initial load will include the pre-rendered HTML, then it will be hydrated/made interactive with JS.&#x20;

There are many rendering options in Next.js "transition here"
